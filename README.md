# What is virtualization?
Virtualization is a technology that enables the creation of virtual environments from a single physical machine, allowing for more efficient use of resources by distributing them across computing environments.

Using software, virtualization creates an abstraction layer over computer hardware, dividing a single system’s components such as processors, memory, networks and storage into multiple virtual machines (VMs).
Each VM runs its own operating system (OS) and behaves like a separate physical computer, despite sharing the same underlying hardware.

# What is a virtual machine?
A virtual machine (VM) is a virtual representation or emulation of a physical computer that uses software instead of hardware to run programs and deploy applications.

By using the resources of a single physical machine—memory, CPU, network interface and storage—VMs enable businesses to run multiple machines virtually (with different operating systems) on a single device.

VMs are typically referred to as guests, with one or more “guest” machines running on a physical machine called the “host” machine. VM technology includes virtual servers, virtual server instances (VSIs) and virtual private servers (VPSs).
